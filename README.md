# HashTables
Custom implementation of a hashtable including 3 different type of hash functions (division, multiplication and universal). Handling of collisions, including chaining and open addressing (linear, quadratic, double-hashing). For chaining, a custom doubly linked list will also be implemented (insert at head, insert at tail, search and deletion).
